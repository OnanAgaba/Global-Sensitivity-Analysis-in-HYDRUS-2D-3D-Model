# Global-Sensitivity-Analysis-in-HYDRUS-2D-3D-Model


Evaluating the sensitivity analysis in hydrodynamics processes, such as water flow and solute transport in the soil, is essential for understanding the parameters' influence on the model. This analysis allows the determination of soil hydraulic parameters with better accuracy for targetted calibration. In this context, we evaluated GSA in HYDRUS (2D/3D) model using the Salib library in Python. The objective function RMSE was used to compare the measured and simulated soil water content at two observation nodes.
