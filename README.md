Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) in Hydrus-1D
Evaluate the sensitivity analysis in the hydrodynamics processes is essential to understand the parameters' influence in the Soil Water Content (SWC). This analysis allows the determination of hydrodynamic parameters with better accuracy. In this context, this project evaluated GSA in a robust Hydrus-1D model. For this, was used the Sobol Sensitivity Analysis (DOI:10.1016/S0378-4754(00)00270-6) presents in the SALib library. The objective function used was the NSE coefficient, which compared the measured and simulated SWC.
