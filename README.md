# Global-Sensitivity-Analysis-in-HYDRUS-2D-3D-Model


Evaluating the sensitivity analysis in the hydrodynamics processes (water flow and solute transport) is essential to understand the parameters' influence on the model. This analysis allows the determination of soil hydraulic parameters with better accuracy for targetted calibration. In this context, this project evaluated GSA in HYDRUS (2D/3D) model using the Salib library in Python. The objective function RMSE was used to compared the the measured and simulated soil water content at two observation nodes.
